**What to say, what to share**

Repeated attempts to do so will be dealt with according to the guidelines regarding warnings and up to, and including temporary or permanent bans.

IT Advice: Though some of us are very tech savvy, we cannot diagnose and fix all computer/ phone issues. There are many variables to such issues. We would implore you to always go through your search engine of choice or Discord Help first to help resolve issues. Many times it’s as simple as shutting down idle programs, updating an application,  rebooting a device, or refreshing an Internet Service Provider’s modem or rebooting a wifi router. If after exhausting online avenues you still are having issues, the Administrator Team would be happy to assist you in that endeavour. Responses will be read within 24 hours and attempts to solve done as soon as possible.
